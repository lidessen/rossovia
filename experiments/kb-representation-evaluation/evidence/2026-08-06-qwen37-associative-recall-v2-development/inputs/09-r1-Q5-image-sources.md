## Agent Interaction

Agent processors receive jobs and use Shilu tools to inspect sources, search
existing entries, and propose operations.

The interaction contract is the same for any agent:

1. Claim a job.
2. Read source material through the core.
3. Search for related entries using catalog, vector, and graph indexes.
4. Submit structured operations.
5. The core validates and commits or rejects operations.
6. The job is marked done, blocked, or needs review.

## Incremental Knowledge Workflow

new source
  -> register source
  -> enqueue digest-source job
  -> normalize source facts
  -> extract candidate entries
  -> search existing entries
  -> decide create / update / supersede / ignore / review
  -> commit operations
  -> update indexes

## Principles

- Entries are the source of truth.
- Indexes are rebuildable projections.
- Raw sources are preserved as evidence.
- Agents propose operations; the core validates and commits them.
- CLI and MCP expose the same stable operation surface.
- Capture is separate from interpretation.
- Knowledge growth must handle duplication, conflict, supersession, and review.
- AI is optional infrastructure, not a core dependency.

### Source

A `Source` is raw input from a session, transcript, hook payload, file import,
meeting note, issue thread, or any other origin.

Sources are evidence. They should be immutable after capture except for metadata
such as processing status.

AnchorId: an_1d21
### Entry

An `Entry` is a small markdown knowledge unit. It is the main source of truth.

Entries should be atomic enough to classify, supersede, link, and retrieve. A
large handbook page can be generated from entries, but should not replace them.

### Entry Event

Every committed change to entries is recorded as an append-only event.

The event log allows audit, rollback, and index rebuilds.
