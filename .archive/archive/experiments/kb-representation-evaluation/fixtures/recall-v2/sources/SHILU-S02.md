### Source

A `Source` is raw input from a session, transcript, hook payload, file import,
meeting note, issue thread, or any other origin.

Sources are evidence. They should be immutable after capture except for metadata
such as processing status.

### Entry

An `Entry` is a small markdown knowledge unit. It is the main source of truth.

Entries should be atomic enough to classify, supersede, link, and retrieve. A
large handbook page can be generated from entries, but should not replace them.

### Entry Event

Every committed change to entries is recorded as an append-only event.

The event log allows audit, rollback, and index rebuilds.
