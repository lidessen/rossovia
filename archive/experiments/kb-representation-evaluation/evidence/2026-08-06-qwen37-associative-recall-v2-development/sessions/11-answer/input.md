## Agent Interaction

Agent processors receive jobs and use Shilu tools to inspect sources, search
existing entries, and propose operations.

The interaction contract is the same for any agent:

1. Claim a job.
2. Read source material through the core.
3. Search for related entries using catalog, vector, and graph indexes.
4. Submit structured operations.
5. The core validates and commits or rejects operations.
6. The job is marked done, blocked, or needs review.

## Incremental Knowledge Workflow

new source
  -> register source
  -> enqueue digest-source job
  -> normalize source facts
  -> extract candidate entries
  -> search existing entries
  -> decide create / update / supersede / ignore / review
  -> commit operations
  -> update indexes

## Indexes

Indexes are projections and must be rebuildable from sources, entries, and
events.

### Vector Index

Semantic retrieval over entry bodies and selected source summaries.

The vector index is a recall mechanism, not authority. A vector hit returns
candidate entry ids; all final operations must reference concrete entries and
sources.

AnchorId: an_0c4e
### Graph Index

Relationship projection:

- related
- supersedes
- contradicts
- derivedFrom
- sameAs
- cites

#### Source Content: Copy-on-Add by Default, Opt-Out Reference

When `shilu source add --path <path>` is called, the content is copied into
`~/.shilu/sources/<type>/` using the existing `pkg/source.StoreRaw()`, and the
internal `RawPath` points to the copy.

Rationale: Sources are the evidence foundation of the knowledge system. If a
source's file disappears, provenance is lost and the processor cannot read
content. Copying on add makes SHILU_HOME self-contained — portable for backup,
sync, and git collaboration — without breaking remote/URL sources.

// Package core implements the deterministic operations of the Shilu knowledge
// system. It validates, commits, and records every mutation to entries,
// sources, and relationships. All state changes go through the Core, which
// enforces the validation rules defined in the design and types packages.
//
// The Core owns the invariant: every mutation is preceded by validation,
// recorded as an event, and persisted through the appropriate store.
