// Package core implements the deterministic operations of the Shilu knowledge
// system. It validates, commits, and records every mutation to entries,
// sources, and relationships. All state changes go through the Core, which
// enforces the validation rules defined in the design and types packages.
//
// The Core owns the invariant: every mutation is preceded by validation,
// recorded as an event, and persisted through the appropriate store.

### Source

A `Source` is raw input from a session, transcript, hook payload, file import,
meeting note, issue thread, or any other origin.

Sources are evidence. They should be immutable after capture except for metadata
such as processing status.

AnchorId: an_1d21
### Entry

An `Entry` is a small markdown knowledge unit. It is the main source of truth.

Entries should be atomic enough to classify, supersede, link, and retrieve. A
large handbook page can be generated from entries, but should not replace them.

AnchorId: an_1d22
### Entry Event

Every committed change to entries is recorded as an append-only event.

The event log allows audit, rollback, and index rebuilds.

## Indexes

Indexes are projections and must be rebuildable from sources, entries, and
events.

### Vector Index

Semantic retrieval over entry bodies and selected source summaries.

The vector index is a recall mechanism, not authority. A vector hit returns
candidate entry ids; all final operations must reference concrete entries and
sources.

AnchorId: an_0c4e
### Graph Index

Relationship projection:

- related
- supersedes
- contradicts
- derivedFrom
- sameAs
- cites

## Principles

- Entries are the source of truth.
- Indexes are rebuildable projections.
- Raw sources are preserved as evidence.
- Agents propose operations; the core validates and commits them.
- CLI and MCP expose the same stable operation surface.
- Capture is separate from interpretation.
- Knowledge growth must handle duplication, conflict, supersession, and review.
- AI is optional infrastructure, not a core dependency.
