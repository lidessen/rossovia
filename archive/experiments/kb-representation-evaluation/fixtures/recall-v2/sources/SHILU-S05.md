### MCP Writes: Job-Scoped Claims Required

All agent-side mutations to entries, links, and reviews must go through the
job system.

**Exceptions:** Direct writes via CLI (human at the terminal) do not require a
job — the human is the authorizing actor. MCP tools for human-invoked
operations may also skip job claims, but every mutation must still carry
provenance metadata (`actor`, `source`).

### Validation Rules

- **Provenance**: Every `entry.create` and `entry.update` must reference at
  least one source, except when the actor is `human`.
- **Status transitions**: Valid transitions are `active → superseded`,
  `active → draft`, `draft → active`. Other transitions are rejected.
