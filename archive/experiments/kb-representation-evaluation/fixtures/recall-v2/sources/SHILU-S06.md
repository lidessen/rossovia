# SHILU-S06

AnchorId: an_6c60
#### Source Content: Copy-on-Add by Default, Opt-Out Reference

When `shilu source add --path <path>` is called, the content is copied into
`~/.shilu/sources/<type>/` using the existing `pkg/source.StoreRaw()`, and the
internal `RawPath` points to the copy.

Rationale: Sources are the evidence foundation of the knowledge system. If a
source's file disappears, provenance is lost and the processor cannot read
content. Copying on add makes SHILU_HOME self-contained — portable for backup,
sync, and git collaboration — without breaking remote/URL sources.
